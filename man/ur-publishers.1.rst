:Manual section: 1

Synopsis
========

ur-publishers *[options]* *command* *[args]*

Description
===========

*ur-publishers* is the command through which
users can update and retrieve the list of the
user repository publishers and register themselves
as publishers.

Commands
===========

* list

    Lists all the registered publishers
    on the User Repository.

* register              
    *target_address*

    Register a new publisher on the User Repository.
    An anti-spam fee is currently active on all
    User Repository deployments to avoid package name
    squatting and spamming the publishers list.
    See the 'Enrolling fees' section below for
    further informations.

* update

    Updates the list of registered publishers
    on the User Repository.

Networks
==========

Currently available networks are
Gnosis and DogeChain, respectively
for purchasing and selling applications
with Dollars and Dogecoins.

Enrolling fees
================

Current enrolling one-time anti-spam fees
for User Repository publishers are:

* 10 Dollars on the Gnosis Network.
* 10 Dogecoins on DogeChain.

Fees are sent to Ur authors to account
for the User Repository development costs.

Publishing applications on the User Repository 
does not require publishers to sign up,
still unregistered publishers don't have their
applications indexed and searchable through the
*ur-packages* command and for users to install
them they have to know the unregistered publisher's
addresses in advance and manually input it
at install/run time using the '-P' option.
