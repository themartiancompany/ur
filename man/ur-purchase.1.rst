--------------------------------------------------------
User Repository application purchase command
--------------------------------------------------------
:Version: ur-purchase |version|
:Manual section: 1

Synopsis
========

ur-purchase *[options]* *package* *publisher* *revision*

Description
===========

*ur-purchase* is the command to use to purchase
applications on the Ur user repository and application
store.

Purchases are non-revocable and valid for the specific
revision (version) of the purchased build recipe.

Packages (programs, libraries) must be purchased
even if they are free.

Packages can be purchased at an higher price
compared to target at user discretion.

Application store fees
=======================

Publishing packages on the User Repository is permissionless
and free, still when the repository is used a 'store' and
applications are sold for money, a 'fair' share of the application
price is sent to Ur authors to account for development and
software maintainance costs.

For both Dollars and Dogecoins purchases Ur authors shares
are the following:

* 5%  for applications sold between $1 / 1 DOGE,
* 10% for applications sold between $5 / 5 DOGE,
* 20% for applications sold for over $10 / 10 DOGE.

Ur authors reserve the right to update the shares percentages
in subsequent versions of the User Repository contracts
to maintain them 'fair'.

In no case Ur authors can prohibit users' access
to their purchase applications.

Due to the permissionless nature of the store though, Ur authors
reserve the right to inform users a legal entity may have required
them to publicly tell purchasing a certain application
constitutes a law infringement in certain jurisdictions, in order
not to be considered complicit of the infringements.

Currently available networks are
Gnosis and DogeChain, respectively
for purchasing applications with
Dollars and Dogecoins.
