Synopsis
========

ur *[options]* *package*

Description
===========

*ur* is the reference implementation of the Ur,
the decentralized, distributed, uncensorable, undeletable,
permissionless user repository and application store
of Life and DogeOS.

Publishing
===========

Applications can be permissionless published on the
User Repository using the reference *pub* [1]
publishing tool.

Check out pub manual to learn how to publish
applications.

While not strictly required, in order to have
their applications globally shown to users
of the ur applications, developers must
register to the repository using the
*ur-publishers* program.

Registration is permissionless, still a small
anti-spam enrolling fee is active to avoid
package name squatting and common spam.

Currently available networks are
Gnosis and DogeChain, respectively
for purchasing and selling applications
with Dollars and Dogecoins.
